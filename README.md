> Cinebench R20 results for the new Ryzen 5000 lineup have surfaced...
> 
> 300$ price category is interesting: The new 6 core is close to the old similarly priced 8 core model in MT performance (-13%). And 22% faster in ST.
> 
> 5600X: ST=604, MT=4312
> 3700X: ST=494, MT=4856

> I am predicting that 5600X is a very good gaming chip indeed. Should beat pretty much every CPU currently in the market in gaming (tie with the current Intel flagships). But let's wait for benchmarks :)

> But there's a large gap between 5600X (299$) and 5800X (449$) price points. Something is clearly missing in between. Would be nice to see a 65W 5700X 8-core model.

> 64 cores with 64 GB of RAM is too little. Need at least 128 GB for a setup like that, while 256 GB is recommended (2 GB per thread).
